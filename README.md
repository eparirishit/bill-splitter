# SplitScan

**AI-powered receipt scanning and bill splitting.**

SplitScan turns shared receipts into fair, itemized splits in minutes—so you spend less time on the math and more time on what matters.

## Why SplitScan

Splitting group expenses—dinners, groceries, trips—often means manual data entry, spreadsheets, and back-and-forth. Splitwise keeps everyone square, but itemizing who had what has always been the bottleneck.

SplitScan removes that friction. Point your camera at the receipt; our AI extracts items and prices. You assign who had what, review the split, and sync one tap to Splitwise. Accurate splits, less effort, fewer mistakes.
