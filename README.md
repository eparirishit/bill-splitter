# Bill Splitter: AI-Powered Bill Splitting for Splitwise

**Objective:** To simplify and automate the process of splitting shared expenses, especially itemized bills like groceries, by leveraging AI for data extraction and seamlessly integrating with Splitwise for expense tracking. This project aims to overcome the limitations of manual item-by-item splitting in existing tools, saving users time and effort.

## Problem Solved

Manually splitting bills with multiple items among different people can be tedious and error-prone. Existing tools like Splitwise are excellent for tracking shared expenses, but often lack the granularity to easily divide individual items on a receipt among specific group members. This application addresses that gap by:

*   Automating the extraction of items and prices from receipts.
*   Providing a clear, guided workflow for assigning items to individuals.
*   Syncing the detailed split back to Splitwise, maintaining a familiar expense tracking environment.

4.  **AI Extraction & Review:** The AI extracts items and prices. Review and make any necessary corrections (Future Scope).
5.  **Select Group & Members:** Choose the relevant Splitwise group and confirm the members involved in this specific bill.
6.  **Assign Items:** Go through the list of extracted items and assign each one to the respective member(s) who consumed or are responsible for it.
